		<h2 style="text-align:center">System Overview</h2>
		<p>In the last few years, word clouds have become a standard tool for abstracting, visualizing, and comparing
		text documents. For example, Word clouds were used in 2008 to contrast the speeches of then US
		presidential candidates Obama and McCain. A word
		cloud of a given document consists of the most important (or most frequent) words in that document.
		Each word is printed in a given font and scaled by a factor roughly proportional to its importance (the
		same is done with the names of towns and cities on geographic maps, for example). The printed words
		are arranged without overlap and tightly packed into some shape (usually a rectangle).
		<br>
		<br>
		
		Many practical tools, like Wordle, with its high quality design, graphics, style and functionality popularized
		word cloud visualizations as an appealing way to summarize the content of a webpage, a research paper,
		or a political speech. While similar tools are popular, most of them have a potential
		shortcoming: They do not visualize the relationships between the words in any way, as the placement of
		the words is completely independent of their context. But humans, as natural pattern-seekers, cannot help
		but perceive two words that are placed next to each other in a word cloud as being related in some way.
		In linguistics and in natural language processing if a pair of words often appears together in a sentence,
		then this is seen as evidence that this pair of words is linked semantically. When visualizing the given
		text with a word cloud, it makes sense to place such related pair of words close to each other.

		<p>The system relies on a geometric model behind drawing word clouds in which sementically related words are placed
		close to each other. The formal model is described in a series of research papers:
