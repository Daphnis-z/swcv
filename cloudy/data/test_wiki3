Word clouds and tag clouds are popular tools for visualizing text. The practical tool, Wordle took word clouds to the next level with high quality design, graphics, style and functionality. Such word cloud visualizations provide an appealing way to summarize the content of a webpage, a research paper, or a political speech. Often such visualizations are used to contrast two documents; for example, word cloud visualizations of the speeches given by the candidates in the 2008 US Presidential elections were used to draw sharp contrast between them in the popular media. While some of the more recent word cloud visualization tools aim to incorporate semantics in the layout, none provide any guarantees about the quality of the layout in terms of semantics. We propose a formal model of the problem, via a simple vertex weighted and edge-weighted graph. The vertices in the graph are the words in the document, with weights corresponding to their frequency (or normalized frequency). The edges in the graph correspond to semantic relatedness, with weights corresponding to the strength of the relation. Each vertex must be drawn as a rectangle with fixed dimensions and with area determined by its weight. The goal is to "realize" as many edges as possible, by placing vertex-boxes next to each other if the corresponding vertices are connected.
